# SolarHome

This is a project that seeks to improve the control of our energy consumption and generation. Since Solar energy is becoming more accesible, so must be the data that enables smart grids and home automation (domotics).
The first hardware/software combo for Solar Home is: The Solar Home Power Meter

Harware:
Voltage and Current sensors monitoring both the input and output of electricity from a home or business.
It calculates power factor, logs consumption and reports to a database.

Software:
1. Setup for sensor chip to connect to the cloud and report data.
2. Algorithms to calculate power factor and data logging both offline and online
3. Database to gather data from all the sensors
4. Interface to access personal profile and consumption data
5. Big data analysis tools and visualisation dashboards
6. Same structure but for other sensors such as hot water heating and consumption, weather stations, air quality, etc.
